This is a short guide on how to pronounce my name more or less accurately for native English speakers.
<br>
<br>
The first name, Lvzhou, breaks into two syllables.
<ol type="1">
	<li> The first syllable Lv can be pronounced as <b>Lu</b>, and ideally as <b>Lü</b> with ü pronounced as in German.</li>
	<li> The second syllable zhou can be pronounced as <b>Chow</b> (as in Chow groups).
</ol>

As for the last name, pronouncing it as <b>Chern</b> (as in Chern classes) is close to accurate. I share the same last name (in Chinese) with Shiing-Shen Chern.
