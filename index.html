			I am an R. H. Bing postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://www.ma.utexas.edu/">the Department of Mathematics</a>
			at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. 
			I received my PhD from <a href="https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>
			under the supervision of <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc">Danny Calegari</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am interested in geometric topology, geometric group theory and dynamics. Topics I specifically studied include stable commutator length, 
			which is a relative version of the Gromov-Thurston norm and dual to quasimorphisms, and mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces (such as the plane 
			minus a Cantor set, which occurs naturally in dynamics).
			</p>
			<p>
			Here is my <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/CV.pdf">CV</a>.

			<p>
			The letter "v" in my first name really stands for "ü", a missing vow in English, pronounced as in German.
			Simply call me Joe unless you are curious about <a href="./name.html">the accurate pronunciation.</a>

	<b>Short description</b>: 
	For any orientable surface S of infinite type, we show any finite subgroup of its mapping class group can be realized
	as a group of isometries for some hyperbolic metric on S. 
	We use this to classify torsion elements in certain big mapping class groups,
	and also show that topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity do not
	embed continuously into the mapping class group of S.
	Finally, we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of S are finite, and locally compact subgroups are
	discrete.

	<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/paper/sclgap.pdf">Spectral gap of scl in graphs of groups and 3-manifolds</a>, 
	<i>submitted</i>, 69 pages, 
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14146">arXiv 1910.14146</a>.
	<br>
	<b>Short description</b>: We show a sharp lower bound 1/2 for the stable commutator length (scl) of any hyperbolic element 
	in a group acting on a tree, provided that every edge stabilizer is <i>relatively torsion-free</i> in vertex stabilizers. 
	The sharp bound becomes 1/2-1/n if the edge stabilizers are <i>n-relatively torsion-free</i> in vertex stabilizers.
	As an application, we show any element in a graph product of torsion-free groups has scl at least 1/2 unless it is supported in a complete subgraph. 
	This in particular implies a sharp gap 1/2 for all right-angled Artin groups.
	We also characterize scl in vertex stabilizers, which allows us to show that any 3-manifold group has a spectral gap, that is a constant C such that
	any element g has either scl(g)>=C or scl(g)=0. We also classify elements whose scl vanish.
	The method is topological in nature. In many cases we also construct explicit quasimorphisms detecting these lower bounds, including a new short 
	proof of the gap 1/2 in free groups.

	<b>Short description</b>: Let G denote the mapping class group of the plane minus a Cantor set. We show that every action of G on the 
	circle is either trivial or semi-conjugate to a unique minimal faithful action on the so-called simple circle. In the appendix, we compute 
	the second homology of the mapping class group of the sphere minus a Cantor set.

	<i>Invent. Math.</i>, <b>221</b>, no. 2, 329-396.
	<br>
	<b>Short description</b>: Let G be a group acting on a tree with cyclic edge and vertex stabilizers. 
	Then stable commutator length (scl) is rational in G. 
	A large portion of the paper concentrates on the special case of Baumslag-Solitar groups, giving a criterion for existence of extremal surfaces, 
	and proving that scl in so-call "surgery" families varies predictably and converges to scl in free groups. 
	This is a homological analog of the phenomenon of geometric convergence in hyperbolic Dehn surgery.

	2. <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/paper/sclgapfp.pdf">Spectral gap of scl in free products</a>, 
	<i>Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.</i> <b>146</b> (2018), no.7, 3143-3151.
	<br>
	<b>Short description</b>: We show that for a free product of torsion-free groups, scl(g) is at least 1/2 for any g not conjugate into any factor.
	Similar sharp bounds are obtained assuming the factors have no small torsion. The method is topological and new for scl estimates, 
	and is pushed further to groups acting on trees in "Spectral gap of scl in graphs of groups and applications" with Nicolaus Heuer. 
	The method turns out to be closely related to Anton Klyachko's car motion argument used in his elegant proof of the Kervaire conjecture for 
	free products of torsion-free groups.

   1. <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/paper/sclfp.pdf">Scl in free products</a>, 
   <i>Algebr. Geom. Topol.</i>, <b>18</b> (2018), no. 6, 3279-3313.
	<br>	
	<b>Short description</b>: We investigate scl in free products, and show that scl is rational in free products of groups with vanishing scl. 
	We further prove that the property of isometric embedding with respect to scl is preserved under taking free products. 
	The method of proof gives a way to compute scl in free products which lets us generalize and derive in a new way several well-known formulas. 
	Finally we show that scl in free products of cyclic groups behaves in a piecewise quasi-rational way 
	when the word is fixed but the orders of factors vary.
	<!--<br>
	<b>Update</b>: The rationality result is generalized in my new paper "Scl in graphs of groups" where a key observation from this paper is used.
